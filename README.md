## How to compile to native

### Preconditions

- make sure GraalVm is installed (`sdk install java 23.r20-nik`) and the default JDK by checking that `native-image` is available as a command. (of course this assumes that [sdk is installed](https://sdkman.io/install))
- make sure gcc is installed (`sudo apt-get install gcc`)
- on Ubuntu install libz-dev (`sudo apt-get install libz-dev`), if not on Ubuntu check the link in the troubleshooting section

### Compile Source
Compile to native by executing:
```
./gradlew nativeCompile
```

You should now be able to execute the native binary:
```
./build/native/nativeCompile/native-spring-echo-kotlin
```

### Run the native binary
Now you can invoke the echo-server with a GET [http://localhost:8080/echo/any_msg](http://localhost:8080/echo/any_msg), e.g. with curl:
```
curl http://localhost:8080/echo/any_msg
```

## Troubleshooting

- if you get a BUILD FAILED with
```
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lz: No such file or directory
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
```

**TLDR**: on Ubuntu do `sudo apt-get install libz-dev`
